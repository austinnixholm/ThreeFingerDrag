# ![icon](https://i.ibb.co/JcnqD2W/png64x64-TFD.png)  ThreeFingerDrag

ThreeFingerDrag is a lightweight tool that emulates the functionality of three-finger drag from Mac OS, but on Windows 8 and later. 

## Usage

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/austinnixholm/ThreeFingerDrag/releases/) and run the installer. You can run the application via the desktop shortcut or from the start menu.

The application runs in the background of the system, and can be configured by clicking the system tray icon.

To run on startup of Windows, open the tray menu and select the "Run on startup" option. 

**NOTE:** It's recommended to remove any existing three-finger swipe gestures within *Touchpad Settings* in order to prevent possible interference.
